# Olympic-Games-Simulation-using-Linked-Lists

### Description:
In this repository we will present our work in our first year as computer science engineering student at **ESI**, *"Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure d'Informatique"* (*Details will be mentionned*)

**- Libraries we have used:**
- stdlib.h
- stdio.h
- Windows.h
- conio.h
- time.h

*And we used e-speak in order to generate sounds.*

**PS:** This program is executable only on windows, because we used the *windows.h* library

### Setup:
#### - Build e-speak in order to play the sound in our program: 
check those ressources fo that: https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/blob/master/docs/building.md#windows

#### - Install windows.h 
If you want to check whether MSVC is installed on your system and windows.h is available, you can try running the following command for windows in the bash shell:

``` echo "#include <windows.h>" | cl /c /EHsc - ```

#### - Install conio.h
Check those ressources for that: https://github.com/thradams/conio
