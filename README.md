# Olympic-Games-Simulation-using-Linked-Lists

### Description:
In this repository we will present our work in our first year as computer science engineering student at **ESI**, *"Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure d'Informatique"* (*Details will be mentionned*)

**- Libraries we have used:**
- Windows.h
- conio.h


**PS:** This program is executable only on windows, because we used the *windows.h* library

### Setup:
#### - Build e-speak in order to play the sound in our program: 
check those ressources fo that: https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/blob/master/docs/building.md#windows

#### - Install windows.h 
If you want to check whether MSVC is installed on your system and windows.h is available, you can try running the following command:
``` echo "#include <windows.h>" | cl /c /EHsc - ```

#### - Install conio.h
Check those ressources for that: https://github.com/thradams/conio
